I’m a 𝐌𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐢𝐜𝐬 & 𝐑𝐨𝐛𝐨𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐬 𝐄𝐧𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐫 with ~𝟑 𝐲𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐬 of combined professional experience, including R&D internships and full-time engineering roles. I've designed, built, and deployed robotics hardware and embedded systems for various domains, including medical devices and industrial automation, directly improving efficiency by up to 80% and reducing defects by 30–50% in some deployments.

I specialize in integrating real-world sensor data, intelligent embedded platforms, and agile robotics hardware to address autonomy challenges. Recently, I:

• 𝗛𝘆𝗯𝗿𝗶𝗱 𝗴𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱/𝗮𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗼𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗶𝗻𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Designed a dual-mode robot with 4-wheel mobility and quadcopter flight, integrated using ROS2, LiDAR, ultrasonic, and camera-based perception for warehouse and construction site inspection missions.
• 𝗪𝗿𝗶𝘀𝘁 𝗿𝗲𝗵𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗲𝘅𝗼𝘀𝗸𝗲𝗹𝗲𝘁𝗼𝗻: Built a mechatronics-based, ergonomically aligned exoskeleton using high-torque BLDC actuators, motion tracking sensors, and adaptive impedance control — delivering ±0.1 Nm precision for neurorehabilitation.
• 𝗣𝗖𝗕 𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗲𝗺𝗯𝗹𝘆 𝗮𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 & 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴: Automated a sensor manufacturing line to 80% throughput by integrating pick-and-place and reflow oven systems; produced 15+ MCUs and multilayer sensor boards with embedded quality control.

𝐌𝐲 𝐜𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐝𝐞:
• ROS2, Gazebo, SLAM, and control algorithms for autonomous navigation
• Real-time sensor fusion using IMU, LiDAR, camera, and embedded MCU stacks
• Hands-on development of robotics hardware, including 4-layer PCBs and fine-pitch soldering
• Rapid prototyping in Fusion 360, SolidWorks, Altium PCB, and implementation on Jetson Nano & Raspberry Pi platforms
• Algorithm development in Python, MATLAB/Simulink, and Embedded C

I get excited about opportunities where I can solve end-to-end robotics challenges, from system modeling to field testing, and thrive in fast-paced environments where sensors meet software. Currently, exploring opportunities in robotics hardware, embedded autonomy, and field-ready intelligent systems.
